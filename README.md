# Overview
'image_generator.py' is a program designed to create an image where every pixel is a randomly-generated colour. The result resembles colourful television static.

The *sys*, *os*, and *random* modules are used from the standard library, as well as *Pillow (PIL)* for manipulating the image. Make sure that these are installed before running the program.

# How do I use the program?
The program is designed to be run from the command line, and requires two additional arguments to be provided for the image's *width* and *height* values, respectively.
